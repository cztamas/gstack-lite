  Clear the edit boundary set by /gl-freeze, allowing edits to all directories
  again. Use when you want to widen edit scope without ending the session.
  Use when asked to "unfreeze", "unlock edits", "remove freeze", or
  "allow all edits". (gstack-lite)

## Lite Preamble

Before following this skill:

1. Read relevant project instructions first: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor rules, or local equivalents.
2. Prefer the existing project patterns, frameworks, helper APIs, and test style.
3. Ask before destructive or hard-to-reverse operations.
4. Keep changes scoped to the user's request and avoid unrelated refactors.
5. Use browser/design tools only when available. If unavailable, degrade to host-native browser tools, screenshots, wireframes, or written review.
6. Read `ETHOS.md` from this skill directory when the workflow touches product direction, design judgment, architecture, or scope tradeoffs.
7. Report what changed, what was verified, and any remaining risk.

Lite paths:

- Skill ethos: `ETHOS.md` in this skill directory.
- State and generated artifacts: active repo `.gstack-lite/` (resolved as `$GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR`; override with `GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR`)
- Browser CLI: `gstack-browser` from the `gstack-browser` npm package
- Design binary, when installed: `$HOME/.gstack-lite/design/dist/design`
- Before reading or writing project state, run `eval "$($HOME/.gstack-lite/bin/gl-slug 2>/dev/null)"` to populate `$GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR` and `$BRANCH`

## User Question Format

When a skill tells you to ask the user, ask one concise question and include the decision context they need. Present options as A/B/C when that makes the tradeoff clearer.

For option sets that differ in coverage, include:

- `Recommendation: <option>`
- `Completeness: N/10` on every option
- One sentence explaining what that option includes or omits

For option sets that differ in kind rather than coverage, do not assign completeness scores. Add exactly this note instead:

`Note: options differ in kind, not coverage - no completeness score.`

## Completeness Principle - Boil the Lake

With AI-assisted implementation, shortcuts that save a human hours often save only minutes. When the user is deciding between a partial fix and the complete version, bias toward the complete version if the blast radius is understood and verification is practical.

Use `Completeness: N/10` to make coverage explicit. A low score is acceptable only when the user intentionally chooses a smaller scope or when the complete version is genuinely risky.

## Search Before Building

Before building or recommending an unfamiliar pattern, search the codebase, local docs, and available current references. Read `ETHOS.md` from this skill directory for the full framework.

- **Layer 1:** tried and true built-ins, standard library, established framework features.
- **Layer 2:** current popular libraries or patterns. Useful, but scrutinize the maintenance and fit.
- **Layer 3:** first-principles reasoning for cases where standard answers are wrong.

If first-principles reasoning contradicts the standard approach, call it out as **[EUREKA]** and explain why this case is different.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:

- **DONE** - completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** - completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** - cannot proceed; state the blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** - missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Review Readiness Dashboard

For gstack-lite, do not call full gstack review-log tools. After a review skill completes, summarize readiness from the review you just ran and any directly available `.gstack-lite/` artifacts in the active repository.

Display a compact dashboard with rows for Eng Review, CEO Review, Design Review, and Outside Voice when relevant. Mark missing rows as not run. Treat the dashboard as conversation output only unless a plan file is available.

## Plan File Review Report

If the host provides an active plan file path, update or append a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section using the review you just completed and any visible review context. If no active plan file is available, skip this section silently.

Do not read or write full gstack review logs. Do not invent runs that did not happen.

# /gl-unfreeze - Clear Freeze Boundary

Remove the edit boundary set by `/gl-freeze`, allowing edits to all directories.

## Clear the boundary

```bash
eval "$($HOME/.gstack-lite/bin/gl-slug 2>/dev/null)"
STATE_DIR="${GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.gstack-lite}"
if [ -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt" ]; then
  PREV=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt")
  rm -f "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
  echo "Freeze boundary cleared (was: $PREV). Edits are now allowed everywhere."
else
  echo "No freeze boundary was set."
fi
```

Tell the user the result. With no boundary file, the lite workflow allows edits
in all directories. To restrict again, run `/gl-freeze` again.
