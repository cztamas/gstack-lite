  Systematic debugging with root cause investigation. Four phases: investigate,
  analyze, hypothesize, implement. Iron Law: no fixes without root cause.
  Use when asked to "debug this", "fix this bug", "why is this broken",
  "investigate this error", or "root cause analysis".
  Proactively invoke this skill (do NOT debug directly) when the user reports
  errors, 500 errors, stack traces, unexpected behavior, "it was working
  yesterday", or is troubleshooting why something stopped working. (gstack-lite)

## Lite Preamble

Before following this skill:

1. Read relevant project instructions first: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor rules, or local equivalents.
2. Prefer the existing project patterns, frameworks, helper APIs, and test style.
3. Ask before destructive or hard-to-reverse operations.
4. Keep changes scoped to the user's request and avoid unrelated refactors.
5. Use browser/design tools only when available. If unavailable, degrade to host-native browser tools, screenshots, wireframes, or written review.
6. Read `ETHOS.md` from this skill directory when the workflow touches product direction, design judgment, architecture, or scope tradeoffs.
7. Report what changed, what was verified, and any remaining risk.

Lite paths:

- Skill ethos: `ETHOS.md` in this skill directory.
- State and generated artifacts: active repo `.gstack-lite/` (resolved as `$GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR`; override with `GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR`)
- Browser CLI: `gstack-browser` from the `gstack-browser` npm package
- Design binary, when installed: `$HOME/.gstack-lite/design/dist/design`
- Before reading or writing project state, run `eval "$($HOME/.gstack-lite/bin/gl-slug 2>/dev/null)"` to populate `$GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR` and `$BRANCH`

## User Question Format

When a skill tells you to ask the user, ask a **Blocking User Question**. This is a gate, not narration.

## Blocking User Question Protocol

Use this protocol for every instruction that says to ask the user, wait for the user, get approval, or confirm a choice. A request to pause or stop for feedback is a blocking gate only when it includes a concrete question or decision for the user.

1. Prefer a host-provided user-input or question tool when one is explicitly available in the current tool list.
2. If no such tool is available, make the question the final response for this turn and stop. Do not continue with planning, implementation, review sections, or guessed defaults in the same turn.
3. Resume the skill only after the user answers. Interpret the answer, then continue from the instruction immediately after the gate.
4. Never answer your own question. Never inline a question and keep going. Never build a plan from guessed answers when the workflow asked for user input.
5. At a **STOP** point, stop immediately after asking the Blocking User Question unless the instruction explicitly says no question is needed.

Write one concise question and include the decision context the user needs. Present options as A/B/C when that makes the tradeoff clearer.

For option sets that differ in coverage, include:

- `Recommendation: <option>`
- `Completeness: N/10` on every option
- One sentence explaining what that option includes or omits

For option sets that differ in kind rather than coverage, do not assign completeness scores. Add exactly this note instead:

`Note: options differ in kind, not coverage - no completeness score.`

## Completeness Principle - Boil the Lake

With AI-assisted implementation, shortcuts that save a human hours often save only minutes. When the user is deciding between a partial fix and the complete version, bias toward the complete version if the blast radius is understood and verification is practical.

Use `Completeness: N/10` to make coverage explicit. A low score is acceptable only when the user intentionally chooses a smaller scope or when the complete version is genuinely risky.

## Search Before Building

Before building or recommending an unfamiliar pattern, search the codebase, local docs, and available current references. Read `ETHOS.md` from this skill directory for the full framework.

- **Layer 1:** tried and true built-ins, standard library, established framework features.
- **Layer 2:** current popular libraries or patterns. Useful, but scrutinize the maintenance and fit.
- **Layer 3:** first-principles reasoning for cases where standard answers are wrong.

If first-principles reasoning contradicts the standard approach, call it out as **[EUREKA]** and explain why this case is different.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:

- **DONE** - completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** - completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** - cannot proceed; state the blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** - missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Review Readiness Dashboard

For gstack-lite, do not call full gstack review-log tools. After a review skill completes, summarize readiness from the review you just ran and any directly available `.gstack-lite/` artifacts in the active repository.

Display a compact dashboard with rows for Eng Review, CEO Review, Design Review, and Outside Voice when relevant. Mark missing rows as not run. Treat the dashboard as conversation output only unless a plan file is available.

## Plan File Review Report

If the host provides an active plan file path, update or append a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section using the review you just completed and any visible review context. If no active plan file is available, skip this section silently.

Do not read or write full gstack review logs. Do not invent runs that did not happen.

# Systematic Debugging

## Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Fixing symptoms creates whack-a-mole debugging. Every fix that doesn't address root cause makes the next bug harder to find. Find the root cause, then fix it.

---


## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

Gather context before forming any hypothesis.

1. **Collect symptoms:** Read the error messages, stack traces, and reproduction steps. If the user hasn't provided enough context, ask ONE Blocking User Question at a time.

2. **Read the code:** Trace the code path from the symptom back to potential causes. Use Grep to find all references, Read to understand the logic.

3. **Check recent changes:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>
   ```
   Was this working before? What changed? A regression means the root cause is in the diff.

4. **Reproduce:** Can you trigger the bug deterministically? If not, gather more evidence before proceeding.

5. **Check investigation history:** Search prior learnings for investigations on the same files. Recurring bugs in the same area are an architectural smell. If prior investigations exist, note patterns and check if the root cause was structural.

## Scope Lock

After forming your root cause hypothesis, lock edits to the affected module to prevent scope creep.

Identify the narrowest directory containing the affected files. If the bug spans
the entire repo or the scope is genuinely unclear, skip the lock and note why.
Otherwise, write the boundary to the freeze state file:

```bash
eval "$($HOME/.gstack-lite/bin/gl-slug 2>/dev/null)"
STATE_DIR="${GSTACK_LITE_STATE_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.gstack-lite}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "<detected-directory>/" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Debug scope locked to: <detected-directory>/"
```

Substitute `<detected-directory>` with the actual directory path (e.g., `src/auth/`). Tell the user: "Edits restricted to `<dir>/` for this debug session. This prevents changes to unrelated code. Run `/gl-unfreeze` to remove the restriction."

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

Check if this bug matches a known pattern:

| Pattern | Signature | Where to look |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Race condition | Intermittent, timing-dependent | Concurrent access to shared state |
| Nil/null propagation | NoMethodError, TypeError | Missing guards on optional values |
| State corruption | Inconsistent data, partial updates | Transactions, callbacks, hooks |
| Integration failure | Timeout, unexpected response | External API calls, service boundaries |
| Configuration drift | Works locally, fails in staging/prod | Env vars, feature flags, DB state |
| Stale cache | Shows old data, fixes on cache clear | Redis, CDN, browser cache, Turbo |

Also check:
- `TODOS.md` for related known issues
- `git log` for prior fixes in the same area - **recurring bugs in the same files are an architectural smell**, not a coincidence

**External pattern search:** If the bug doesn't match a known pattern above, WebSearch for:
- "{framework} {generic error type}" - **sanitize first:** strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, SQL, customer data. Search the error category, not the raw message.
- "{library} {component} known issues"

If WebSearch is unavailable, skip this search and proceed with hypothesis testing. If a documented solution or known dependency bug surfaces, present it as a candidate hypothesis in Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

Before writing ANY fix, verify your hypothesis.

1. **Confirm the hypothesis:** Add a temporary log statement, assertion, or debug output at the suspected root cause. Run the reproduction. Does the evidence match?

2. **If the hypothesis is wrong:** Before forming the next hypothesis, consider searching for the error. **Sanitize first** - strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, SQL fragments, customer identifiers, and any internal/proprietary data from the error message. Search only the generic error type and framework context: "{component} {sanitized error type} {framework version}". If the error message is too specific to sanitize safely, skip the search. If WebSearch is unavailable, skip and proceed. Then return to Phase 1. Gather more evidence. Do not guess.

3. **3-strike rule:** If 3 hypotheses fail, **STOP**. Ask the user:
   ```
   3 hypotheses tested, none match. This may be an architectural issue
   rather than a simple bug.

   A) Continue investigating - I have a new hypothesis: [describe]
   B) Escalate for human review - this needs someone who knows the system
   C) Add logging and wait - instrument the area and catch it next time
   ```

**Red flags** - if you see any of these, slow down:
- "Quick fix for now" - there is no "for now." Fix it right or escalate.
- Proposing a fix before tracing data flow - you're guessing.
- Each fix reveals a new problem elsewhere - wrong layer, not wrong code.

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

Once root cause is confirmed:

1. **Fix the root cause, not the symptom.** The smallest change that eliminates the actual problem.

2. **Minimal diff:** Fewest files touched, fewest lines changed. Resist the urge to refactor adjacent code.

3. **Write a regression test** that:
   - **Fails** without the fix (proves the test is meaningful)
   - **Passes** with the fix (proves the fix works)

4. **Run the full test suite.** Paste the output. No regressions allowed.

5. **If the fix touches >5 files:** Ask the user to flag the blast radius:
   ```
   This fix touches N files. That's a large blast radius for a bug fix.
   A) Proceed - the root cause genuinely spans these files
   B) Split - fix the critical path now, defer the rest
   C) Rethink - maybe there's a more targeted approach
   ```

---

## Phase 5: Verification & Report

**Fresh verification:** Reproduce the original bug scenario and confirm it's fixed. This is not optional.

Run the test suite and paste the output.

Output a structured debug report:
```
DEBUG REPORT
========================================
Symptom:         [what the user observed]
Root cause:      [what was actually wrong]
Fix:             [what was changed, with file:line references]
Evidence:        [test output, reproduction attempt showing fix works]
Regression test: [file:line of the new test]
Related:         [TODOS.md items, prior bugs in same area, architectural notes]
Status:          DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
========================================
```

Log the investigation as a learning for future sessions. Use `type: "investigation"` and include the affected files so future investigations on the same area can find this:

```bash
```

## Important Rules

- **3+ failed fix attempts -> STOP and question the architecture.** Wrong architecture, not failed hypothesis.
- **Never apply a fix you cannot verify.** If you can't reproduce and confirm, don't ship it.
- **Never say "this should fix it."** Verify and prove it. Run the tests.
- **If fix touches >5 files -> user question** about blast radius before proceeding.
- **Completion status:**
  - DONE - root cause found, fix applied, regression test written, all tests pass
  - DONE_WITH_CONCERNS - fixed but cannot fully verify (e.g., intermittent bug, requires staging)
  - BLOCKED - root cause unclear after investigation, escalated
